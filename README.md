### My Portfolio

I have built this portfolio after finishing my 6 month bootcamp education to apply for junior developer jobs and show my skills. The website consists of 5 sections and visitors can navigate through a navbar which tranforms into a hamburger menu below 550px to enable a more smooth mobile user experience. Visitors can scroll thorugh to see all of the sections or can use the navbar to access information more quickly.

## Sections 
- Home
- About Me
- Projects
- Testimonials
- Contact Me

Visitors can visit the project section of the website where they will see a shot description of the projects and have the option of seeing the code or the live version of the projects.
