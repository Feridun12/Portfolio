### My Portfolio

I have built this portfolio after finishing my 6 month bootcamp education to apply for junior developer jobs and show my skills. The website consists of 5 sections and visitors can navigate through a navbar which tranforms into a hamburger menu below 550px to enable a more smooth mobile user experience. Visitors can scroll thorugh to see all of the sections or can use the navbar to access information more quickly.

## Sections 
- Home
- About Me
- Projects
- Testimonials
- Contact Me

Visitors can visit the project section of the website where they will see a short description of the projects and have the option of seeing the code or the live version of the projects. Furthermore, visitors can contact me through sending an email to me through the contact form in contact me section or can click the social media icons to contact via social media.
